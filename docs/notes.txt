Classes involved:
1. Actual RL algo class
2. RL Controller class
3. MAC class

Initialization order:
Node -> MAC -> Controller -> RL class
MAC: init -> run -> _start_rl_agents -> _run_rl_single_agent -> _run_joint_agent -> Controller: decide_joint_action -> Agent: select_action(context)
context == state??

What we want:
An env class that produces the state as context and we have an agent class that can simply accept that state, choose a valid action and coninue

1. Wrap SimPy part in a gym env
2. Break control at MAC decide_joint_action
